# My Esports Journey

My first experience with online first-person shooter games began on mobile, with *PUBG Mobile*. I started playing casually in late 2018 during school breaks, mostly with friends and my brother. In 2020, I switched to another mobile game, *Critical Ops*, which had a more tactical approach similar to *Counter-Strike*. This shift pulled me deeper into the gaming world, and I found myself spending more time improving my gameplay, even reducing the time I spent on digital art to focus on being better at *Critical Ops*.

Soon after, a friend introduced me to *Call of Duty Mobile*. At first, I didn’t enjoy it as much as *Critical Ops*, but things changed when he introduced me to a team that was looking to enter the esports scene. In Nigeria, it was rare to see new players excel at sniping, but after a few practice matches with other teams, I started gaining recognition. It also helped that I posted gameplay highlights on my YouTube channel, which served as a way to document my progress.

The breakthrough came when my team won our first tournament. I shined during the event and was awarded the MVP, as well as titles like "Next Rated Player" and "Best Sniper" of the year.

In 2021, after the lockdowns eased, I was preparing to focus more on school when Cyclone Gaming, an esports team, offered me a 3-month contract. Although the money wasn’t much, the idea of getting paid to play was exciting. My time with Cyclone Gaming was intense—training sessions lasted over 4 hours each day, and weekends were dedicated to tournaments. By the end of the year, I extended my contract for a full year while juggling university studies.

My final tournament with the team was the biggest one we participated in that year. We placed third, but the experience prompted me to reflect on my future, especially as I had just graduated from university. While esports had been thrilling, I realized it wasn’t a sustainable path for me in Nigeria. I began exploring different life paths, even considering the crypto space, but nothing felt stable enough. That’s when I asked myself what skill I’d want to have even if there were no jobs or if the world started over—and that’s when I decided to learn how to code.
