# My Art Journey

Art has always been a passion of mine, even if I never pursued it professionally. My earliest memory of drawing goes back to when I was 4 years old, watching my mum (who wasn't the best artist) sketch a figure in the sand with a stick. When I turned 7, she bought me a soccer comic, *Super Strikas*, which sparked my interest in drawing. I started replicating the comic panels and even tried creating my own soccer-themed comic.

At 11, during a summer holiday, I had the chance to apprentice at an art workshop on the university campus where my mum worked in Lagos. I spent eight hours a day observing and sketching portraits. After a month, I noticed that my portraits were beginning to resemble the people I was drawing, which motivated me to keep improving.

After that summer, I told my parents I wanted to pursue a career in art. They weren’t supportive, insisting that it wasn’t a viable career path. So, I shifted my focus to commerce and business, eventually majoring in Accounting at the University of Lagos. Although art became just a hobby, I continued to sketch in my notebooks, though it never consumed me like it once had.

In 2019, during my third year of university, I discovered digital art through YouTube. Seeing other artists my age or older excel in digital art, especially those who had started around the same time I had my first art workshop experience, reignited my passion. Inspired by their work, I bought an iPad and began learning digital art during the COVID pandemic. I noticed my skills improving, and I often wonder where I’d be if I had never stopped. However, that dream never fully materialized as I eventually found myself drawn into the eSports world.
