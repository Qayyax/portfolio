# My Code Journey

During my final year at the University of Lagos in Nigeria, I was deeply involved in esports. My team competed in the biggest tournament of the year, but we finished third, which didn’t bring in much prize money. Realizing that esports in Africa wasn’t sustainable and required a significant time commitment to excel, I decided to return to my accounting career. However, the work quickly became monotonous, with repetitive tasks that left me feeling unfulfilled. Growing up, I was always fascinated by computers, games, and art—these were my true passions.


In early 2022, I stumbled upon an opportunity with ALX Africa, a platform offering free scholarships to become a software engineer within a year. I jumped at the chance, and that’s where I was introduced to essential tools like the terminal, Linux, Git, Vim, Emacs, C, and Python. Although I was still navigating the challenges of “tutorial hell,” I gradually became more comfortable with coding.


Motivated by my growing interest in technology, I applied for a Master's degree in Big Data Analytics at Trent University in Canada.

# Pursuing a Master's in Big Data Analytics

During my first semester at Trent, the curriculum focused on R programming, statistics, and research. I’ve always had a passion for statistics, which was a major reason I chose this program. However, I found myself missing the creative aspect of coding and building projects. After discussing this with my brother, a software engineer, he asked me the same question he had posed nearly a year earlier: “What do you want to build?”


That question reignited my desire to create web applications. During the August break, I discovered Scrimba's Frontend Career Path and immediately enrolled. I loved the hands-on approach, where I wasn’t just learning but also building projects on my own. Scrimba emphasized the importance of self-reliance, encouraging me to Google what I didn’t know instead of waiting for someone to provide answers.


When the new semester began, I paused my Scrimba studies to focus on school. This semester introduced me to big data, databases, containerization, machine learning, and data mining. I tackled numerous projects, working with Docker, various databases, Python for web scraping, Terraform for image recognition models, and PySpark for data processing. While challenging, I enjoyed the course so much that I was later hired as a teaching assistant and lab marker by my professor, particularly to help Mac users.


Around that same time, I started an online course on Backend Development from Boot.Dev. This course stood out because it approached the subject like a Computer Science program, starting with the basics of programming, then progressing through math, data structures, and algorithms before diving into HTTP and web concepts with Node.js. It also introduced Go for building web servers and SQL databases. Although I’m still completing this course, it has significantly boosted my confidence in reading code and understanding why certain practices, like nested loops, aren’t always ideal.


As my final semester approached, I decided to complete my Scrimba course and dive into learning the React library. I’ve been practicing and refining my skills ever since.
